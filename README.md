This is a simple app Andriod app built with kotlin that allows users to managea music playlidst.
The app lets users add songs with details such as title, artist, name, rating and comments, and view a list of all added songs along with the ratings.
The Idea behind the PlaylistManagerApp was inspired by common features found in major music applications such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music — where users create and manage personal playlists.
However, this app takes a lightweight and educational approach
•	Instead of streaming real songs, users manually add song information
•	Ratings and comments allow personal tracking, like “liking” or reviewing music
•	Everything is stored locally in memory (no database or login required)
•	It’s a great beginner project to understand arrays, UI, activity navigation, and user input handling in Android
Used TEXTVIEW , BUTTON AND DIFFERNT FONTS TO MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY.

Andriod studio , kotlin language and azure labs were used.
